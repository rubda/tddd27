# Applicants
This is a project made for the course TDDD27 - Advanced Web Programming.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rubda/tddd27.svg?token=y1NXzEJyZUZutosMXEQb&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rubda/tddd27)

### Technical requirements
My initial thoughts regarding the technical aspects for this project is to build a MERN stack. Basically a web stack containing
- MongoDB (NoSQL database, to persist data)
- Express (web application framework, providing my REST API)
- React (front-end framework/library)
- Node  (JavaScript runtime environment)

I'm not a big fan of JavaScript, so I thought I would go all in to experience what the JS world regarding web has to give. Besides the MERN stack I will use Docker to package my web application and perhaps also deploy it on AWS if everything goes smoothly.

### Functional requirements
The web application that I'm going to build is nothing fancy, but something I think will show what React is capabable of. Basically the idea is to build a web interface, where a user is shown a list of applicants that needs to processed through. The user will able to read and make notes about the applicants and mark if an applicant has been contacted or not. Basically a 'control panel' to handle applicants of all sorts.
